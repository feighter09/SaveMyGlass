HUD/Safety features for driving with Google Glass. Also uses weather underground. HUD Features Display of MPH, RPM, Weather, as well as the speed limit for the current road. When Glass recognizes that you're nodding off behind the wheel, it flashes red and sounds an alarm in your ear to wake you up. In the event that Glass experiences accident-level G-forces, Save My Glass will start capturing video immediately and calls 911 for you.
